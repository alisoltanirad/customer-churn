# customer-churn

This project is designed to help businesses gain valuable insights
into customer behavior by predicting whether a customer is likely
to leave within a specific period of time. Leveraging the power of
XGBoost classifier and the scalability of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP),
our model provides actionable predictions to enhance
customer retention strategies and optimize business outcomes.
Reduced customer churn directly contributes to improved business profitability,
customer loyalty, and long-term success.


## Key Features

- **Predictive Model**: We utilize the powerful XGBoost classifier
to create a predictive model that analyzes customer data
and assigns a churn prediction label.
- **Feature Engineering**: Our model is trained on a range of customer data attributes,
including demographics, usage patterns, engagement metrics, and more.
- **Scalable Deployment**: The project is deployed on the Google Cloud Platform,
allowing for seamless scalability to handle large volumes of customer data.


## Requirements

**customer-churn** is a Python project, to run it locally
you need to install Python version 3.11, and Python dependencies
are listed in *requirements.txt* (application main requirements),
*requirements-test.txt* (test requirements), and *requirements-dev.txt*
(requirements for development of the project).


## Dataset

We use sample open-source data from Kaggle for this project's proof of concept.
You can use the same dataset to reproduce the model and get your application
up and running.
